## Introduction

This specification covers comprehensive UI improvements and bug fixes for the portfolio website, focusing on error resolution, professional styling, and enhanced user experience with macOS-style interactions.

## Glossary

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component files to be error-free, so that the application runs without console errors or build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Portfolio_Website is built, THE WindowManager SHALL compile without any TypeScript or linting errors
2. WHEN the Portfolio_Website is built, THE Hero3D SHALL compile without any TypeScript or linting errors  
3. WHEN diagnostics are run on component files, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL return zero error messages
4. WHEN missing imports are detected, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL have all required dependencies properly imported
5. WHEN the application starts, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL load without any console errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the about me photo section to have professional and minimal animations, so that the interface feels polished and not distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the about me section, THE WindowManager SHALL display the photo without revolving border animations

5. WHERE status indicators are present, THE WindowManager SHALL display them in a minimal and elegant style

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want a custom macOS-style cursor with trailing effects, so that the website feels native and provides enhanced visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving the mouse on the website, THE CursorFollow SHALL display a cursor identical to macOS pointer design
2. WHEN the cursor moves, THE CursorFollow SHALL create a trailing effect with fading particles
3. WHILE browsing the website, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL hide the default browser cursor completely
4. WHEN the cursor is stationary, THE CursorFollow SHALL maintain the macOS appearance without trail particles
5. WHERE the cursor moves quickly, THE CursorFollow SHALL generate smooth trail animations with progressive opacity fade

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive file review and issue resolution, so that all components work harmoniously without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing all component files, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL have consistent import statements
2. WHEN checking for unused variables, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL have clean code without warnings
3. WHILE running diagnostics, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL pass all TypeScript type checking
4. WHEN components interact, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL maintain proper prop passing and state management
5. WHERE styling conflicts exist, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL resolve CSS and animation conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the hero section to be fully functional and error-free, so that the main landing experience is smooth and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads, THE Hero3D SHALL render all animations without errors
2. WHEN interacting with hero elements, THE Hero3D SHALL respond smoothly to user interactions
3. WHILE the hero section is visible, THE Hero3D SHALL maintain consistent performance across different devices
