# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the enhancement of the custom cursor component to provide a more engaging and visually appealing cursor experience with advanced following effects, smooth animations, and interactive feedback.

## Glossary

- **CursorFollow**: The React component that manages the custom cursor display and animations
- **Trail_Effect**: Visual particles that follow the cursor movement with fading animations
- **Cursor_Glow**: A subtle glow effect around the main cursor element
- **Interactive_Feedback**: Visual changes when hovering over clickable elements
- **Smooth_Following**: Physics-based cursor movement that feels natural and responsive
- **Portfolio_Website**: The complete React-based portfolio application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want a visually appealing custom cursor that enhances the browsing experience, so that the website feels modern and interactive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving the mouse on the website, THE CursorFollow SHALL display a custom cursor with smooth animations
2. WHEN the cursor moves, THE CursorFollow SHALL create a subtle glow effect around the main cursor
3. WHILE browsing the website, THE Portfolio_Website SHALL hide the default browser cursor completely
4. WHEN the cursor is stationary, THE CursorFollow SHALL maintain a gentle pulsing animation
5. WHERE the cursor design is displayed, THE CursorFollow SHALL use modern gradients and smooth edges

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the cursor to have smooth following effects with trailing particles, so that cursor movement feels fluid and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cursor moves, THE CursorFollow SHALL generate trailing particles that follow the cursor path
2. WHEN trail particles are created, THE CursorFollow SHALL animate them with progressive opacity fade
3. WHILE the cursor moves quickly, THE CursorFollow SHALL create more visible trail effects
4. WHEN the cursor moves slowly, THE CursorFollow SHALL reduce trail intensity for subtlety
5. WHERE trail particles exist, THE CursorFollow SHALL remove them smoothly after a short duration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the cursor to provide interactive feedback when hovering over clickable elements, so that I can easily identify interactive areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over buttons, THE CursorFollow SHALL scale up and change color to indicate interactivity
2. WHEN hovering over links, THE CursorFollow SHALL transform to show clickable state
3. WHILE hovering over interactive elements, THE CursorFollow SHALL display enhanced glow effects
4. WHEN leaving interactive elements, THE CursorFollow SHALL smoothly return to default state
5. WHERE drag handles exist, THE CursorFollow SHALL show appropriate drag cursor styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the cursor effects to be performant and responsive, so that they don't impact the website's performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering cursor effects, THE CursorFollow SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN managing trail particles, THE CursorFollow SHALL limit the number of active particles
3. WHILE animating cursor effects, THE CursorFollow SHALL use hardware acceleration
4. WHEN the cursor is idle, THE CursorFollow SHALL reduce animation intensity to save resources
5. WHERE performance is critical, THE CursorFollow SHALL prioritize smooth cursor movement over complex effects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the cursor to have contextual animations that respond to different areas of the website, so that the browsing experience feels dynamic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over the hero section, THE CursorFollow SHALL display enhanced particle effects
2. WHEN moving over project cards, THE CursorFollow SHALL show project-specific styling
3. WHILE in the contact section, THE CursorFollow SHALL use communication-themed effects
4. WHEN hovering over the dock, THE CursorFollow SHALL integrate with dock hover effects
5. WHERE different content sections exist, THE CursorFollow SHALL adapt its appearance contextually
